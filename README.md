## AI Explanation ü§ñ
The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, a **decision-making algorithm** for perfect-play games.  

- The AI **simulates all possible moves** and chooses the one with the **highest score**.  
- Winning moves = `+10`, Losing moves = `-10`, Draw = `0`  
- The AI **blocks the player** if they are about to win.  
- This ensures **competitive gameplay** where the AI never loses.
